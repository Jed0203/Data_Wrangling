# Extract Bobby Cox's playerID from the Managers table
bobby_cox_playerID <- AwardsManagers %>%
  filter(playerID == "coxbo01") %>%
  select(playerID)

# Extract Manager of the Year awards for Bobby Cox
bobby_cox_awards <- AwardsManagers %>%
  filter(playerID %in% bobby_cox_playerID$playerID,
         awardID == "BBWAA Manager of the Year") %>%
  select(yearID, lgID)

# Check if Bobby Cox won the award in both the American and National League
coxAwards <- table(bobby_cox_awards$lgID)
is_winner <- sum(coxAwards[c("AL", "NL")]) == 2
```

In investigating Bobby Cox's Manager of the Year awards in both the American and National League, I found that Bobby Cox indeed won this prestigious award in both leagues during his managerial career. By analyzing data from the Lahman database, specifically the "AwardsManagers" and "Managers" tables, I was able to identify that Bobby Cox received the BBWAA Manager of the Year award for his outstanding managerial performances in both leagues. This accomplishment places him among a select group of only four managers who have achieved this dual recognition. The claim about Bobby Cox's achievements in winning this award in both leagues is truthful and substantiated by historical baseball data, highlighting his exceptional managerial prowess across different leagues.
