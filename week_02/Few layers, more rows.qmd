```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
head(flights)
```

```{r}
hist(flights$distance)
```

```{r}
hist(flights$air_time)
```

```{r}
# Load the necessary library if it's not already loaded
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
# Create a scatter plot with custom axis labels
plot(flights$distance, flights$air_time, 
     xlab = "Distance (miles)", 
     ylab = "Air Time (minutes)", 
     main = "Scatter Plot of Distance vs. Air Time")
```

## Summary

The relationship between distance and air_time is positive linear relationship because the points tend to be straight line.
