## Articles

[The CRUTCH Rankings](https://pudding.cool/2023/06/asterisks/): The way charts present about each player's\
stats, and the style and the colors of this article gives me video vibe. It really catches my eyes.\
Font choice could be better.

[A Map of Places in the US with the Same Name](https://pudding.cool/2023/03/same-name/): It has good visualization presents data in a clear and understandable way.\
The article title could be more visible.

[A journey of emotional awareness, where we uncover the power of naming and visualizing your feelings.](https://pudding.cool/2022/12/emotion-wheel/): I like the storytelling and interactive content for audience. Guiding the viewer through a narrative that helps me understand the data's significance and implications.\
There's a pie chart in the article could be movable, that'd be better.
