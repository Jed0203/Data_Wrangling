## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

#Assignment Operator <-:
```{r}
Alt+Minus Key
```


#Create a New Code Chunk in .rmd Files:
```{r}
Ctrl+Alt+I
```



#Run One Line of Code (even within a code chunk):
```{r}
Ctrl+Enter
```


#Run an Entire Code Chunk:
```{r}
Ctrl+Shift+Enter
```


#Pipe Operator %>%:
```{r}
Ctrl+Shift+M
```
This one requires library(tidyverse) to be loaded. Below you can see how to switch to the native pipe operator which doesnâ€™t require tidyverse.
